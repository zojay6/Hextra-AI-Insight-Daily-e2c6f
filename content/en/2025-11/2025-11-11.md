Plus, the official word is they've generously cranked up rate limits for **ChatGPT Plus** and other users, giving **Pro and Enterprise users** priority processing. So, if your API calls are running low or you've just got some simple tasks, why not [give this "mini" code powerhouse a spin (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/22666)? It's already rocking CLI and IDE extensions, with API access just around the corner! ✨

### Frontier Research

1.  Moonshot AI just dropped a bombshell in the domestic large model scene by open-sourcing its most powerful thinking model, **Kimi K2 Thinking**! 🤯 This model absolutely crushed it in the "ultimate human test," surpassing GPT-5 in performance. What's even crazier is its training cost: a mere **$4.6 million**, totally redefining the industry's "big effort for big miracles" rule with extreme cost-effectiveness. Moonshot AI didn't just open-source the model weights; they also included a full suite of training scripts and commercial licenses. This is undoubtedly a massive gift to developers worldwide, so [come and learn more (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/22647) about it! 🎁

2.  The key to LLM inference efficiency, **KV Cache**, actually hides a huge trap! 😱 When the cache size exceeds the model's pre-trained context window, model performance plummets dramatically – way scarier than a GPU memory explosion. A [latest research paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04686) points out that aggressively clearing the cache and breaking the continuity of **positional encoding (RoPE)** only makes the model spout "nonsense." Researchers are advocating that future cache management strategies must respect the model's architectural limitations and positional structure to truly achieve efficient and accurate generation. Just something to keep in mind! 🤔

3.  Science fiction is officially becoming reality, transforming a single sentence into a real-world object! 🤯 Researchers have proposed a [new technical process (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02162) that combines **3D generative AI** with **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, enabling robots to automatically assemble multi-component objects based on natural language instructions. The VLM acts as the "designer" here, performing zero-shot inference on an object's geometry and function, then intelligently breaking it down into structural and panel components. This research opens up a whole new world for personalized manufacturing, allowing anyone to command robots to "create" simply through conversation! ✨

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  McKinsey's latest report has dropped, revealing an awkward truth: a whopping **88% of businesses** have jumped on the AI bandwagon, but only **39%** are actually reaping the benefits and seeing profit growth 🤔. This [ "AI State of 2025" report (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNjc1NzUzMw==&mid=2247840831&idx=4&sn=1cc94321e0eb25950aba05e3e81923df) points out that most companies are still stuck in the "feels good to use AI" phase, and despite the **AI Agent** hype, only a select few are truly reshaping their business processes. The bottom line? The AI dividend is polarizing severely, and only **high-performing enterprises** bold enough to overhaul their business models will turn investments into cold, hard cash! 💰<br/>![AI News: Current Status of AI Application in Enterprises](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01k9q933skfyebsfjj032b7chp.avif)<br/>![AI News: AI ROI Analysis](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01k9q937h5esg86wb5tq34wzfh.avif)

5.  Seriously, stop treating **Notebook LLM** as just a simple AI writing tool – that's a total waste! 🤦‍♀️ [Shaonan Plidezus's view (AI News)](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/6911f5b9826250ef6b9e237b) hits the nail on the head, pointing out that its core value lies in "research," not "writing." You should be using it to "research your research," digging for deeper insights. Then, and only then, should you use our unparalleled human brains to "write your masterpieces." Now *that's* the right way for humans and AI to team up! ✨

6.  Peter Thiel's "Zero to One" theory is like a splash of cold water, waking up all those imitators obsessed with going "from 1 to 100"! 🤯 As [this blogger's shared video (AI News)](https://x.com/JamesGoong/status/1987765228927648087) points out, the next Mark Zuckerberg won't be building another social networking site, because every truly great innovation is unique and simply cannot be replicated. The essence of business is uniqueness, not just hyper-competition in existing lanes. Now *that's* something every entrepreneur should seriously chew on. 🤔<br/><video src="https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1987375656750227458/vid/avc1/1280x720/WBhuKUuq_X7-_Q7f.mp4?tag=21" controls="controls" width="100%"></video>

7.  Just how rampant is "borrowing" in the content creation scene? One blogger spilled the tea: Dan Koe's content alone has spawned countless viral self-media accounts! 😩 [A blogger lamented (AI News)](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/1987676721039208706) how from Twitter to Xiaohongshu, and even Douyin, everyone is furiously rehashing his AI content production flow. What's even sadder is that many of these rehashers don't even add a shred of their own thought – they're pure "content porters." 😵‍💫 Talk about unoriginality!
