### Keeping Your Personal Data
The Company will only keep your Personal Data for as long as it's needed for the purposes spelled out in this Privacy Policy. We'll hang onto and use Your Personal Data to the extent necessary to keep our legal obligations (like, if we need to hold onto your data to follow applicable laws), resolve beefs, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also stash Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data usually sticks around for a shorter period, unless it's used to beef up the security or spiff up the functionality of our Service, or we're legally obligated to hold onto this data for longer periods.

### Moving Your Personal Data Around
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and in any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might get shipped over to — and kept on — computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws might be different from your jurisdiction's rules.

Your thumbs-up to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such info means you're cool with that transfer.

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure Your data is treated securely and totally in line with this Privacy Policy. No transfer of Your Personal Data will happen to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place, including the security of Your data and other personal information.

### Ditching Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask us to help you ditch the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might give you the power to zap certain info about you right from within the Service itself.

You can always update, amend, or delete your info any time by logging into Your Account (if you have one) and hitting up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. You can also give us a shout to request access to, correct, or delete any Personal Information you've tossed our way.

But heads up, we might need to hang onto certain info when we've got a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so.

### When We Might Spill Your Personal Data

#### Business Deals
If the Company gets caught up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before Your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### The Law Steps In
Under certain circumstances, the Company might be forced to spill Your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (like a court or a government agency).

#### Other Legal Shenanigans
The Company might spill your Personal Data, genuinely believing that such action is necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Keeping Your Personal Data Safe & Sound
The security of Your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but hey, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% bulletproof. While we hustle to use commercially acceptable ways to protect Your Personal Data, we can't guarantee its absolute security.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly scoop up personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you're clued in that your child has given us Personal Data, please hit us up. If we figure out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifying parental consent, we'll take steps to ditch that info from our servers.

If we need to lean on consent as a legal basis for processing your info and your Country requires parental consent, we may ask for your parents' consent before we grab and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

We've got zero control over, and take absolutely no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll give you a shout about any changes by posting the fresh new Privacy Policy on this page.

We'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service before the changes kick in, and update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

It's a good idea to peek at this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they're posted on this page.
