# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we"). Please, before you dive into using our services, make sure to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our site, you're essentially saying 'I agree' to these terms. 🤝

## 1. Service Overview
Our services are designed to offer users paid subscription content and exclusive member perks. This includes cool stuff like blog posts, unique resources, e-books, and even community interaction. Just a heads-up: some of this awesome content is only available to our subscribed users! 💡

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- To register an account, users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password. 📧
- Users are responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, transferring or sharing accounts is a big **NO-NO**. 🚫
- This site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they're found violating these terms. 🛑

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Our subscription services are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll always see the exact fees clearly displayed on the checkout page. 💰
- All payments are securely handled via third-party platforms (like Stripe or PayPal) – just so you know, we never store your payment info on our end! 🔒
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew**, so if you don't want to continue, make sure to cancel before your current billing cycle ends. 🗓️
- Our **14-day refund policy** is pretty straightforward: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally apply for a full refund. Just shoot us an email (you'll find it at the end of these terms) explaining why you're not happy. Heads up: this offer is a one-time deal per user. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-time subscriber, all payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely insists otherwise. ↩️

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- All original content's **copyright belongs to this site (hubtoday)**, so you can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our explicit permission. ©
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our content, strictly for personal learning and reading. 📖
- For any commercial use or if you're planning extensive citations, you gotta contact us first to get authorization. ✉️

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- Users are strictly **prohibited** from uploading, publishing, or sharing any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Seriously, don't do it! 🙅‍♀️
- Users are also **prohibited** from using any technical wizardry to mass download, crawl, or crack our member-exclusive content. 🚫
- This site reserves the right to remove any inappropriate content and will not hesitate to **ban users** who violate these rules. 🔨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or even terminate parts or all of our services at any time, and we won't always be able to give you a heads-up beforehand. 🚧
- This site **does not assume liability for compensation** if content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to things like force majeure, server hiccups, or issues with third-party services. Basically, stuff happens sometimes beyond our control. 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information provided on this site is purely for reference and **does not constitute** any form of professional advice – think financial, legal, medical, you name it. We're not pros in those fields! 🛑
- This site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might experience from using our content or services. Use at your own risk! ⚠️

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by, and will be interpreted according to, the laws of the State of California, USA, totally ignoring any conflict of law principles. So, California law is the boss here! 🇺🇸
- For any disputes popping up from or related to these terms, we both agree to try sorting it out with a friendly chat first. If that doesn't work out, you agree to let the courts in Santa Clara County, California handle it. That's where we'll settle any legal beef! ⚖️
